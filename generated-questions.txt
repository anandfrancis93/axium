   Explanation: {"Providing wireless encryption":"INCORRECT: Wireless encryption is handled by protocols like WPA2/3.","Enforcing port-based network access control":"CORRECT: 802.1X is designed to control network access based on the port the device is connected to.","Routing network traffic":"INCORRECT: Routing is handled by routers.","Managing IP addresses":"INCORRECT: IP address management is handled by DHCP."}

2. [true_false] [Bloom 1]
   Q: True or False: 802.1X restricts network access based solely on MAC addresses.
   Answer: False
   Explanation: False. 802.1X provides better security than MAC address filtering by requiring authentication before granting network access.
