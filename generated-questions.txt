============================================================

1. [mcq_single] [Bloom 2]
   Q: What is the primary function of the 802.1X standard?
   Options: To provide port-based network access control using authentication. | To encrypt network traffic between devices on a LAN. | To manage IP addresses on a network. | To route packets between different networks.
   Answer: To provide port-based network access control using authentication.
   Explanation: {"To provide port-based network access control using authentication.":"CORRECT: 802.1X's core function is to control network access based on authentication at the port level.","To encrypt network traffic between devices on a LAN.":"INCORRECT: While encryption can be used in conjunction with 802.1X, it isn't the standard's primary function. Encryption is usually done by protocols like TLS or IPsec.","To manage IP addresses on a network.":"INCORRECT: IP address management is handled by DHCP, not 802.1X.","To route packets between different networks.":"INCORRECT: Routing is the function of routers, not 802.1X."}

   Options: Authenticator | Supplicant | Authentication Server | RADIUS client
   Answer: Supplicant
   Explanation: {"Authenticator":"INCORRECT: The authenticator is the network device (e.g., switch) that mediates access.","Supplicant":"CORRECT: The supplicant is the end-user device that requests access.","Authentication Server":"INCORRECT: The authentication server validates the supplicant's credentials.","RADIUS client":"INCORRECT: The RADIUS client functionality is within the authenticator."}

   Q: Which of the following protocols are used in the 802.1X standard to facilitate authentication and authorization?
   Options: EAP | RADIUS | DHCP | None of the above
   Answer: ["EAP","RADIUS"]
   Explanation: {"EAP":"CORRECT: Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides the framework for different authentication methods.","RADIUS":"CORRECT: Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) allows the authenticator and authentication server to communicate.","DHCP":"INCORRECT: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is used for IP address assignment, not authentication.","None of the above":"INCORRECT: EAP and RADIUS are core components of 802.1X."}

   Q: What is the role of the Authenticator in the 802.1X architecture?
   Options: To validate authentication requests directly. | To act as a conduit for authentication data between the supplicant and the authentication server. | To assign IP addresses to devices on the network. | To encrypt all network traffic.
   Answer: To act as a conduit for authentication data between the supplicant and the authentication server.
   Explanation: {"To validate authentication requests directly.":"INCORRECT: The authenticator does not validate requests directly; it relays them to the authentication server.","To act as a conduit for authentication data between the supplicant and the authentication server.":"CORRECT: The authenticator's primary role is to forward authentication data.","To assign IP addresses to devices on the network.":"INCORRECT: IP address assignment is done via DHCP.","To encrypt all network traffic.":"INCORRECT: Encryption might be enabled on the network, but it's not the authenticator's primary responsibility in the 802.1X context."}

   Q: When a host connects to an 802.1X-enabled switch port, what type of traffic is initially allowed before authentication?
   Options: All network traffic is allowed. | Only EAPoL traffic is allowed. | Only HTTP traffic is allowed. | No traffic is allowed.
   Answer: Only EAPoL traffic is allowed.
   Explanation: {"All network traffic is allowed.":"INCORRECT: 802.1X's purpose is to prevent unrestricted access before authentication.","Only EAPoL traffic is allowed.":"CORRECT: EAPoL (EAP over LAN) must be allowed to enable the authentication process.","Only HTTP traffic is allowed.":"INCORRECT: HTTP may eventually be allowed, but not before EAP authentication is successful.","No traffic is allowed.":"INCORRECT: EAPoL traffic must be allowed to initiate the authentication process."}

7. [true_false] [Bloom 1]
   Q: True or False: The authenticator can read the credentials sent by the supplicant in the EAP packet.

   Options: SNMP | RADIUS | TACACS+ | Kerberos
   Answer: RADIUS
   Explanation: {"SNMP":"INCORRECT: SNMP is used for network management and monitoring.","RADIUS":"CORRECT: RADIUS is the standard protocol for AAA communication between the authenticator and authentication server.","TACACS+":"INCORRECT: TACACS+ is another AAA protocol, primarily used by Cisco, but not standard for 802.1X.","Kerberos":"INCORRECT: Kerberos is an authentication protocol that could be used with EAP but not for the authenticator/server communication."}

   Q: What information does the authentication server use to validate the supplicant's credentials?
   Options: A directory of network objects and user accounts. | The supplicant's IP address. | The supplicant's MAC address. | The switch port number.
   Answer: A directory of network objects and user accounts.
   Explanation: {"A directory of network objects and user accounts.":"CORRECT: The authentication server checks the provided credentials against its database.","The supplicant's IP address.":"INCORRECT: IP addresses are assigned after authentication, usually.","The supplicant's MAC address.":"INCORRECT: While MAC addresses could be used in some cases, 802.1X aims to move away from MAC-based filtering.","The switch port number.":"INCORRECT: The port number is used for identification, but not directly for credential validation."}

10. [true_false] [Bloom 1]
   Q: True or False: 802.1X is only applicable to wired networks.

   Q: What happens if the authentication server is unreachable when a supplicant attempts to connect to an 802.1X-enabled port?
   Options: The supplicant is immediately granted full network access. | The supplicant is denied network access. | The switch caches the supplicant's credentials and retries later. | The switch forwards the request to a backup authentication server, if configured.
   Answer: The supplicant is denied network access.
   Explanation: {"The supplicant is immediately granted full network access.":"INCORRECT: This defeats the purpose of 802.1X.","The supplicant is denied network access.":"CORRECT: Without a valid response from the server, access is typically denied.","The switch caches the supplicant's credentials and retries later.":"INCORRECT: Caching credentials is a security risk and not standard behavior.","The switch forwards the request to a backup authentication server, if configured.":"If a backup server exists, it will attempt to reach that. If not it will deny access."}

14. [true_false] [Bloom 2]
   Q: True or False: 802.1X provides encryption for data transmitted over the network after authentication.
   Answer: False
