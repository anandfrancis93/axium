============================================================

1. [mcq_single] [Bloom 1]
   Q: What is the primary purpose of the IEEE 802.1X standard?
   Options: To provide port-based network access control. | To encrypt all network traffic at the physical layer. | To implement a firewall on a network switch. | To manage IP address assignments on a network.
   Answer: To provide port-based network access control.
   Explanation: {"To provide port-based network access control.":"CORRECT: 802.1X's core function is to control network access based on the port to which a device is connected.","To encrypt all network traffic at the physical layer.":"INCORRECT: While security is enhanced, 802.1X primarily focuses on authentication, not encryption of all traffic.","To implement a firewall on a network switch.":"INCORRECT: 802.1X works alongside firewalls, but is not itself a firewall implementation.","To manage IP address assignments on a network.":"INCORRECT: DHCP is used for IP address assignment; 802.1X focuses on access control."}

   Answer: MAC addresses are difficult to manage and prone to spoofing.
   Explanation: {"MAC addresses are difficult to manage and prone to spoofing.":"CORRECT: MAC address filtering is cumbersome to manage and easily bypassed by MAC address spoofing.","MAC addresses do not provide any security benefits.":"INCORRECT: They provide a small amount of security by obscurity, but it is weak.","MAC addresses cannot be used on wireless networks.":"INCORRECT: MAC addresses are fundamental to Ethernet and Wi-Fi networks.","MAC addresses are only assigned to servers, not client devices.":"INCORRECT: All network-connected devices have a MAC address."}
