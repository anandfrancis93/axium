# Axium Project Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-14
**Current Focus:** GraphRAG Knowledge Graph & Question Generation

---

## Phase Overview

Based on the original roadmap from `PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md`:

| Phase | Component | Status | Completion |
|-------|-----------|--------|------------|
| **1** | Knowledge Graph Preparation | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| **2** | Semantic Relationships | ⏸️ Not Started | 0% |
| **3** | Supabase Integration | ⏸️ Not Started | 0% |
| **4** | Application Integration | ✅ Complete | 100% |

---

## Phase 1: Knowledge Graph Preparation ✅ COMPLETE

**Status:** ✅ Production Ready
**Completion Date:** 2025-11-13
**Documentation:** `PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md`

### Completed Components

- ✅ Neo4j AuraDB instance (844 entities)
- ✅ Curriculum parsing (CompTIA Security+ SY0-701)
- ✅ Entity creation (Domain → Objective → Topic → Subtopic)
- ✅ Hierarchical relationships (CONTAINS, BELONGS_TO)
- ✅ Graph schema and indexes
- ✅ Context summaries for all entities
- ✅ Query testing and validation

### Key Metrics

- **Entities:** 844 total
  - 5 Domains
  - 35 Objectives
  - 347 Topics
  - 457 Subtopics
- **Relationships:** 843 hierarchical
- **Performance:** <50ms single entity queries

---

## Phase 2: Semantic Relationships ⏸️ NOT STARTED

**Status:** ⏸️ Pending
**Priority:** High (foundation for RL system)

### Planned Components

1. **Ontological Relationships**
   - IS_A (inheritance/classification)
   - PART_OF (composition)
   - PREVENTS (security mitigation)
   - USES (tool/protocol relationships)
   - DEPENDS_ON (dependencies)

2. **Prerequisite Learning Paths**
   - Extract learning order from curriculum
   - Create PREREQUISITE relationships
   - Build directed acyclic graph (DAG)

3. **Bloom Taxonomy Assignment**
   - Assign Bloom levels to each entity
   - Tag by cognitive complexity
   - Enable level-appropriate question generation

4. **Difficulty Scoring**
   - Assign difficulty ratings
   - Consider depth, prerequisites, complexity
   - Support adaptive progression

### Why It Matters

Without semantic relationships:
- ❌ Can't determine learning prerequisites
- ❌ Can't build optimal learning paths
- ❌ Can't identify related concepts for review
- ❌ Limited context for question generation

---

## Phase 3: Supabase Integration ⏸️ NOT STARTED

**Status:** ⏸️ Pending
**Priority:** Medium (needed for production)

### Planned Components

1. **Cache Layer**
   - Populate Supabase from Neo4j
   - Cache frequently accessed entities
   - Reduce Neo4j query load

2. **Sync Mechanism**
   - Real-time updates (Neo4j → Supabase)
   - Bidirectional sync where needed
   - Conflict resolution

3. **GraphQL API**
   - Expose graph data via GraphQL
   - Enable efficient client queries
   - Support subscriptions for real-time updates

4. **Caching Strategy**
   - Redis for hot data
   - PostgreSQL for warm data
   - Neo4j as source of truth

### Why It Matters

Without Supabase integration:
- ❌ Direct Neo4j queries from client (expensive)
- ❌ No caching → slow performance
- ❌ No offline support
- ❌ Difficult client-side data management

## Current State Summary

### What Works ✅

1. **Knowledge Graph** - 844 entities with context summaries
2. **Question Generation** - GraphRAG-powered, Bloom-aligned questions
3. **Storage** - Questions stored with full metadata
4. **Question APIs** - 6 endpoints for generation and retrieval
5. **Learning Recommendations** - RL-based topic selection with spaced repetition
6. **Adaptive Difficulty** - Bloom progression, confidence calibration, format selection
7. **Performance Analytics** - Comprehensive user statistics and insights

### What's Missing ⏸️

1. **Semantic Relationships** - No IS_A, PART_OF, prerequisites (Phase 2)
2. **Supabase Cache** - Direct Neo4j queries, no caching (Phase 3)
3. **Frontend UI** - No learning session interface (Future phase)

### Blockers

| Blocker | Impact | Resolution |
|---------|--------|------------|
| No semantic relationships | Can't build prerequisite paths | Complete Phase 2 |
| No Supabase cache | Slow, expensive queries | Complete Phase 3 |
| No frontend UI | Can't test with users | Build learning interface |

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Complete Core Graph Foundation (Recommended)

**Go back and complete Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4**

**Rationale:**
- Semantic relationships are essential for RL system
- Prerequisites needed for intelligent topic selection
- Supabase cache needed for performance
- Proper foundation prevents technical debt

**Timeline:**
- Phase 2: ~2-3 days (semantic extraction + Bloom tagging)
- Phase 3: ~1-2 days (cache setup + sync)
- Phase 4B/C: ~2-3 days (RL logic + adaptive difficulty)

### Option 2: Build Minimal UI First

**Complete Phase 4B/C, then build simple frontend**

**Rationale:**
- Get user feedback early
- Test question generation with real users
- Validate Bloom alignment

**Risk:**
- Building on incomplete foundation
- May need to refactor later
- Limited personalization without Phase 2/3

### Option 3: Generate Question Pool First

**Use existing system to generate 500-1000 questions**

**Rationale:**
- Validate question quality at scale
- Build content library
- Low cost ($3.40-$6.80)

**Risk:**
- API credit constraints (as experienced)
- May regenerate duplicates without cache

---

## Technical Debt

### High Priority

1. **No semantic relationships** - Core graph functionality incomplete
2. **No Supabase cache** - Performance and cost issues
3. **No RL logic** - Can't personalize learning paths

### Medium Priority

1. **No caching layer** - May regenerate duplicate questions
2. **No question validation** - Post-generation only
3. **No analytics tracking** - Can't monitor quality/costs

### Low Priority

1. **Matching format not tested** - Other formats sufficient
2. **No multi-language support** - Single language sufficient for MVP

---

## Cost Analysis

### Completed Work

- **Question Generation:** $0.1915 (28 questions tested)
- **Neo4j AuraDB:** ~$65/month (free tier)
- **Supabase:** Free tier

### Projected Costs (Full Implementation)

**Phase 2 (Semantic Relationships):**
- LLM calls for relationship extraction: ~$5-10
- One-time cost

**Phase 3 (Supabase Cache):**
- No additional cost (free tier sufficient)

**Phase 4B/C (RL Logic):**
- Development only, no API costs

**Question Generation at Scale:**
- 1,000 questions: $6.80
- 10,000 questions: $68.00
